Passion Academy on Instagram: "Just two short years ago today, we opened the doors to our first location with only a few students and a small team of dreamers. It's truly incredible and quite humbling to see how far we've come. We couldn't have done it without the faithful support of our student community, their families and our amazing team of mentors. Thank you! The best is yet to come! \#music \#dance \#rvamusic \#rvadance \#blessed \#thankful \#thebestisyettocome \#passionacademy \#passiondance"
